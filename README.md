It's a 3D model of a helicopter which is moving. Though design may not seem exactly like the real helicopter, I tried to do some unique things here.

Codeblocks IDE, C++ Programming Language, OpenGL 

Features
-	Three dimensional
-	Movable along  a 3D space
-	Rotatable from different perspective
-	3D Lighting
-	Rotating main rotor & tail rotor
-	Controllable movement (using keyboard)
